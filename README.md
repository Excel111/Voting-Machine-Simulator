The Voting Machine Simulator is a Java-based project designed to replicate the functionality of a real electronic voting machine (EVM). Voters can choose from a list of candidates, with each voter’s submission secured by a unique ID check to prohibit multiple votes.  Once voting concludes, the administrator can unlock the results screen to view the total number of votes for each candidate. This project illustrates how digital voting systems can be implemented in a way that is both secure, transparent, and tamper-proof.  It’s a great tool for civic education, mock elections in schools or colleges, and demonstrating event-driven programming and data validation techniques in Java.
